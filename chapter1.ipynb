    "Analysis Tool (CDAT), which uses the Python language. The examples in\n",

    "The basic unit of computation in CDMS is the variable. A variable is essentially a multidimensional data array, augmented with a domain, a set of attributes, and optionally a spatial and/or temporal coordinate system [(see Coordinate Axes)](https://cdms.readthedocs.io/en/readthedocstest/manual/cdms_1.html#coordinate-axes).  As a data array, a variable can\n",
    "be sliced to obtain a portion of the data, and can be used in arithmetic\n",
    "computations. For example, if ``u`` and ``v`` are variables representing\n",
    "the eastward and northward components of wind speed, respectively, and\n",
    "both variables are functions of time, latitude, and longitude, then the\n",
    "velocity for time 0 (first index) can be calculated as:"
