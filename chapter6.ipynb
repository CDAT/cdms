    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Climate Data Markup Language (CDML) is the markup language used to represent metadata in CDMS. CDML is based on the W3C XML standard (https://www.w3.org). This chapter defines the syntax of CDML. Read this section if you will be building or maintaining a CDMS database.\n",
    "\n",
    "XML, the eXtensible Markup Language, makes it possible to define interoperable dialects of markup languages. The most recent version of HTML, the Web hypertext markup language, is an XML dialect. CDML is also an XML dialect, geared toward the representation of gridded climate datasets. XML provides rigor to the metadata representation, ensuring that applications can access it correctly. XML also deals with internationalization issues, and holds forth the promise that utilities for browsing, editing, and other common tasks will be available in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "CDML files have the file extension .xml or .cdml."

    "## Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "A CDML document consists of a nested collection of elements. An element is a description of the metadata associated with a CDMS object. The form of an element is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "&lt;tag> attribute-list  element-content &lt;/tag>\n",
    "or\n",
    "&lt;tag attribute-list />\n",
    "\n",
    "**where**\n",
    "\n",
    "* tag is a string which defines the type of element\n",
    "* attribute-list is a blank-separated list of attribute-value pairs, of the form:\n",
    "* attribute = \"value\"\n",
    "* element-content depends on the type of element. It is either a list of elements, or text which defines the element values. For example, the content of an axis element either is a list of axis values, or is a linear element.\n",
    "* For datasets, the content is the blank-separated list of elements corresponding to the axes, grids, and variables contained in the dataset.\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "CDML Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Tag \tDescription\n",
    "attr \tExtra attribute\n",
    "axis \tCoordinate axis\n",
    "domain \tAxes on which a variable is defined\n",
    "domElem \tElement of a variable domain\n",
    "linear \tLinearly-spaced axis values\n",
    "rectGrid \tRectilinear Grid\n",
    "variable \tVariable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "XML reserves certain characters for markup. If they appear as content, they must be encoded to avoid confusion with markup:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special Character Encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "Character \tEncoding\n",
    "\n",
    "* <  : &lt\\;\n",
    "* &gt; :  &gt\\;\n",
    "* & : &amp\\;\n",
    "* “ : &quot\\;\n",
    "* ‘ : &apos\\;\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the **comment**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Certain “special characters”, such as <, >, and ‘, must be encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "would appear in an attribute string as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* comment = “Certain **&quot\\;**special characters**&quot\\;**, such as **&lt\\;**, **&gt\\;**, and **&apos\\;**, must be encoded.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "In CDMS, all objects in a dataset have a unique string identifier. The id attribute holds the value of this identifier. If the variable, axis, or grid has a string name within a data file, then the id attribute ordinarily has this value. Alternatively, the name of the object in a data file can be stored in the name_in_file attribute, which can differ from the id. Datasets also have IDs, which can be used within a larger context (databases).\n",
    "\n",
    "An identifer must start with an alphabetic character (upper or lower case), an underscore (\\_), or a colon (:). Characters after the first must be alphanumeric, an underscore, or colon. There is no restriction on the length of an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CF Metadata Standard\n",
    "\n",
    "The CF metadata standard defines a set of conventions for usage of netCDF. This standard is supported by CDML. The document defines names and usage for metadata attributes. CF supersedes the GDT 1.3 standard.\n"
